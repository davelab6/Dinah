Dinah is a typeface family (Latin & Devanagari) 
designed by Blondina Elms Pastel for use on the web.
It is be available in regular and bold weights.
The aim is to create a typeface design that users find easy to read
and agreeable to look at, thus enhancing the readers experience. 
Dinah follows the contrast sort (rotation) of the broad nib pen
and displays a modest contrast. Dinah's Devanagari and Latin faces
are designed to complement each other without forcing script assimilation.
